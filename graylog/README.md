Graylog

# Graylog

Graylog is a leading centralized log management solution built to open standards for capturing, storing, and enabling real-time analysis of terabytes of machine data.

# Installation

Start all services with exposed data directories:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Configuration

Graylog [open](http://127.0.0.1:9000) and use login and password:

```
user: admin
password: admin
```

Now you are not sending data to Graylog, so you need to configure an [input](https://docs.graylog.org/en/2.0/pages/getting_started/config_input.html#configure-graylog-input). This will tell Graylog to accept the log messages.
Go back to the Graylog console open in your browser and click System -> Inputs. Then select Syslog UDP and click Launch new input. Fill out the circles with the values in the screen shown below.

```
allow_override_date: true
bind_address: 0.0.0.0
expand_structured_data: false
force_rdns: false
number_worker_threads: 8
override_source: <empty>
port: 12201
recv_buffer_size: 262144
store_full_message: false
```

## Possible problems

you can have a situation when after receiving a message in Graylog your message code will be broken. For fix this

```
xï¿½%ï¿½A ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Zï¿½Lï¿½ï¿½2ï¿½bJï¿½2qï¿½=ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½wCï¿½ï¿½)ï¿½ï¿½aï¿½

```
The reason is collector_sidecar output into the wrong INPUT format(syslog type).
Create a new type INPUT(GELF) and change collector_sidecar output to the new INPUT,everything is OK!
